I enjoy writing, and when I manage to express some thoughts clearly, then I get a sense of achievement.

A quote that is always at the back of my mind when writing a post was from an email discussion that I had with [David Pinnegar](https://www.ft.com/content/79c7c444-a788-11e8-926a-7342fe5e173f) of [Hammerwood Park](https://www.hammerwoodpark.co.uk/) where he wrote: "Wittgenstein's concept that the last barrier to humanity is the understanding of language." It is a reminder how language is used, by who, and for what reason. However, my hope is that when a reader understands the thoughts discussed in this blog they go on to develop their own!

Over the years I have gathered my own thoughts about Wittgenstein's Philosophy which can be found <b>[here](/assets/md/box_file/test).</b>

I try and keep the length of the blog to about a five minute read, or less, so that it can be read while sitting back and drinking a coffee.

The blog uses [GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/).  Over the years I have gathered some [notes](/assets/md/git-notes) about managing the blog and in particular uploading new posts.

<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> service is used to understand how people are accessing the site. This information is collected in an anonymous form and includes the number of visitors to the site.

I have adapted an early version of [HPSTR](https://mademistakes.com/work/hpstr-jekyll-theme/) written [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/about/) and it will continue to change as I learn more about page layouts and different approaches to web navigation.

Video embeds are responsive and scale with the width of the main content block with the help of [FitVids](https://fitvidsjs.com/).

Over the years I have gathered tips on how to [maintain](/assets/md/maintenance) the site which may help you if you are running a Jekyll based blog. In a similar vein when Google has thrown up a few problems their solutions can be found [here](/assets/md/resolved-problems)
