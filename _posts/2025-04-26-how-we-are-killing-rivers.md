There is nothing more disheartening than walking along a river that is dying. It is muddy, littered with rubbish and barely moving. In the UK we have have developed many ways to strangle the life out of rivers.   

Fish are the best indicator of the health of a river. In good health it supports sustainable populations by providing: a good supply of food, air to breath ( yes - fish need oxygen ), areas to breed and hide from predators. Of all of the fish species that a river can support the wild brown trout is the gold standard.  In the UK their population is in a steep decline. Data from the Office for National Statistics indicates that the number of rod-caught trout in the UK has steadily declined by 51% between 1994 and 2019.

The health of a river depends on a number of factors. Currently, <b>pollution</b> is the headline grabber in the shape of sewage discharges. It introduces pathogens and excess nutrients into a river.  Pathogens can cause fin rot, ulcers, gill disease, and systemic infections that weaken immunity and reproductive failures. Still under the heading of pollution is agricultural runoff from fertilizers, pesticides and animal waste that cause eutrophication and algal blooms. [Eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication) is a process where a body of water becomes excessively enriched with nutrients which can lead to plant die-offs, harming species like water crowfoot and pondweeds as well as affecting invertebrates. If that was not enough then there is industrial pollution with chemicals and heavy metals. Finally litter such as plastic bags and sacks, old tyres, paint cans, wood, fridges, bicycles, bottles and the infamous supermarket trolley.

The next factors is <b>land use and recreation</b>. Urbanisation increases more concrete which means less natural absorption, increasing surface runoff and pollution. Deforestation and poor land management reduces natural filtration and increase sediment in rivers. Drainage and canalisation changes to natural river courses alter flow patterns and habitats. Then there is us. Anglers gear, if not properly cleaned, can introduce spores and larvae and other invasive species.  Swimming can introduce  contamination from sunscreen and insect repellents, and disturb sediment and habitats. It's a similar situation with dogs, pathogens can be introduced from their pooing and peeing when they swim in a river. Also, the use of flea deterrents can be harmful to insects living in the river. 

If the above factors are not enough then there is <b>water abstraction</b>. Excessive water is removed for agriculture, industry, or public supply which lowers river levels and harms aquatic life. The list continues with <b>invasive species</b> of non-native species like [American signal crayfish](https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/things-to-do/canal-and-river-wildlife/canal-and-river-invasive-species/signal-crayfish) or [Himalayan balsam](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/himalayan-balsam) which disrupt local ecosystems and outcompete native species.

Finally, the factor that affects us all is <b>climate change</b>. Increased global temperatures affect oxygen levels in a river which impacts on the ability of fish to breath. The increasing frequency of droughts reduce river flow, concentrate pollutants, and shrink habitats. More intense storms cause flooding and spread pollution.

Reducing the impact of one of these factors is an important step but they all have to be addressed at the same time if a river is going to return to full health.  For example, if pollution from sewage discharges was totally eradicated and the rest of the factors stayed the same then there is no guarantee that a river will recover full health.  Next time you are asked to support an organisation that is going to tackle one of these factors, ask them how the other factors will be affected. It won't be until their elimination is coordinated that the wild brown trout will return to all of our rivers.
