<p>
You will be joining a highly dynamic profession with a track record of success that stretches over 4000 years. Mathematicians continue to make major contributions to the development of civilisation, and remain at the centre of creating solutions that affect many aspects of people's lives.
</p>

<p>
<b>Projects</b>
</p>

<p>
You will be involved with a wide range of clients at all levels in organisations
as diverse as education, local and national governments, small to large multinational businesses, policy making bodies and charities. Many of the projects require a pioneering approach to solving complex problems, very often in diverse environments, and may require the development of new mathematical concepts and
techniques. Amongst your roles you will be expected to use modelling and simulation techniques to manage and analyse large
amounts of data. With your mathematical skills and experience you will be expected to help the
clients understand their problems which will enable them to make better decisions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Role</b>
</p>
<p>
You will be required to shape and drive projects from the initial discussions with the client through to successful implementation of the solution. Projects can cover: improving the scheduling of transportation to reduce its impact on the environment, linking DNA information to diseases, predicting the spread of
viruses through populations, developing algorithms used in computer graphics to explore new ways to visually represent data and open up new forms of entertainment, optimisation of manufacturing process to efficiently produce goods, create new mathematical models for space flight which will be used to explore the universe,
model human intelligence that will be applied to improve artificial intelligence, and develop  learning algorithms to be used in developing new business models for e-commerce.
</p>

<p>Responsibilities:</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop the objectives of projects, planning the resources and execute the project
        taking into account risk management, change control and documentation.</li>
    <li>Successfully manage all of the people involved in the project, including the client,
        scientists, engineers, regulatory and standards groups, senior management and other
        functions within an organization.</li>
    <li>Communicate the excitement in developing and applying mathematics to  
        audiences ranging from schools to the general public. Also,
        promote the potential use of mathematics to professions not familiar with
        its capabilities.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Your Background</b>
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Must enjoy finding patterns in every day situations whether it is in the geometry of
        a coastline, the flight path of a tennis ball, or the movement of people through a shopping centre.</li>
    <li>Prepared to sacrifice many hours in answering the question “why?” about the patterns
        that are observed in the surrounding world, and using the insight derived from the answer,
        to predict how the patterns will evolve.</li>
    <li>Courage and determination in developing solutions to mathematical problems, and resilient to skepticism about the role of mathematics in everyday life.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
