The subject of risk has hit the media in connection with the side effects of the [Oxford-AstraZenica](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca) vaccine. But the benefits of the vaccine are being drowned out by the general chatter about the risk of [blood clots](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n774). Risk makes good headlines but are we missing out when the benefits are not included in the discussion?

Every activity that we undertake has both benefits and risks. We are usually motivated by the benefits whether it is joining a fitness club to improve our health, moving job for a better career or having an annual vaccination to prevent serious illness. To get a better balance between the benefits and risk I have developed the following questions:

<b>What is the activity I would like to undertake?</b> It is important to understand as much as possible about what is involved in an activity so that a sensible assessment of the benefits and risks can be made. For example when I started cycling I learned about what is involved by peddling around in the safety of our backyard: learning how to keep my balance without falling off ( which took a few goes ), braking to avoid a wall and learning what can go wrong when cycling too fast.  I also passed my cycling proficiency test at school before I put my foot on the pedal and headed for the big open roads.

Understanding a new activity may involve different approaches such as finding out about it on the web, asking friends or work colleagues, paying for some coaching, or just giving it a go in a safe environment.

<b>What are the benefits and possible risks?</b> Continuing with the example of cycling there are many [benefits](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/cycling-health-benefits#cycling-for-health-and-fitness): increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscle strength and flexibility. There are also mental health benefits which comes from what is called the ["cycling high"](https://mensline.org.au/mens-mental-health/cycling-positive-mental-health/) which increases the circulation of endorphins and improves mood, memory, self-esteem and helps with a better quality of sleep. There is information in the public domain to support the benefits and in the case of cycling there are newspaper articles such as [Eight](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/family-routes/health-benefits/) healthy reasons why you should go cycling this summer or scientifically supported information such as [The top 5 benefits of cycling](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-top-5-benefits-of-cycling ) from Harvard Medical School.

On the risk side of the balance there is the possibility of being hit by a vehicle. This tends to happen at junctions, roundabouts, crossings or when a driver doesn't give a cyclist enough space on the road. Another risk comes from skidding on dangerous road surfaces such as black ice or wet leaves. These risks can be reduced by wearing a helmet, avoiding main roads, wearing highly visible clothing and a helmet. Being aware of other road users and  alert to road conditions can reduce the risk of having an accident. [Statistics](https://ig.ft.com/sites/urban-cycling/) can be found to assess the risk such as when compared on a mile for mile basis people in the UK are more likely to die from walking than cycling.

Answering the questions above should gather enough information to make a balanced decision about the benefits and risk of a new activity. They can be applied to any venture whether it is sending a rocket to Mars, taking up a new sport buying an electric car. They can even be used on activities that we take for granted such as what we eat and drink.


Headlines that lead with risk jeopardise the benefits which in the case of the Oxford-AstraZenica vaccine means saving lives. It is a similar story for many activities that are discussed in the [media](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/72057061.pdf). The concentration on risk and passing by the benefits reduces a balanced debate on whether an activity should be pursued or not. We could be missing out on something that could broaden our horizons and make life more exciting!
