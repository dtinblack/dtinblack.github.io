Dear Noble Prize Committee Members,
</p>

For many years I have read the lectures given by the Noble Prize winners. They are a great
resource for insights into the personalities of the winners and their struggles as they broke new ground in their subjects. The Noble Prize highlights some of the greatest breakthroughs in our understanding of the world that we live in, and although I don’t claim to understand every aspect of the lectures, I find them inspiring. However, it is a curious fact that there is no Noble Prize for mathematics.

I understand that when Alfred Noble left most of his fortune for series of prizes
he stated that they were for those who have shown the "greatest benefit on mankind." However
he limited the subjects to physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace.  
Although I can appreciate that there are many reasons for limiting the number of prizes,
missing out mathematics is a serious lack of recognition of its impact on the “benefits
of mankind.”

Therefore I would like to you to consider a Noble Prize for Mathematics. Mathematics forces
a clear understanding of concepts and assumptions involved in a problem. It provides a logical framework for exploring and understand the world - where would we be without numbers, geometry and algebra ?. Mathematicians use their skill, determination and imagination to extend the boundaries of our knowledge and develop methodologies and techniques that improve the way that we live. It is interesting to note that outside of the awards for literature and peace there is invariably some form of mathematics supporting the subject that has been awarded a prize. Since the first Noble Prize awarded in 1901 mathematicians have made significant breakthroughs in our understanding and impact on the way we live, for example: [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether), [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann), [R. A. Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher), [Rudolf Kálmán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_E._K%C3%A1lm%C3%A1n) are just a few who could have been considered for a prize in mathematics. Imagine how many more breakthroughs in mathematics there would have been with the support of £600,000 prize money !

Of course there are awards for mathematicians, for example [The Abel Prize](http://www.abelprize.no/) which is considered the 'maths Nobel' and through the media raises the profile of mathematics. However, the Nobel brand would raise the profile of mathematics to a higher level and a wider audience.

Although the list of Nobel prizes has stuck to the original list of prizes, adding another subject has been done. The [Sveriges Riksbank
Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/), donated by Sweden's central bank to
celebrate its tercentenary in 1968 has remained on the list. I can appreciate that money
will be required to support the on going prize for mathematics. However, if you signalled
that you were open to the idea of adding mathematics to the list of prizes, then maybe some of the major companies who rely of mathematicians such as Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft, would be willing to set up an endowment to provide the on-going
financial award - what do you think ?

I can appreciate that you are busy assessing future recipients for the Noble Prizes, but please
can you find time to consider adding mathematics to the list. Its inclusion to the list of Noble Prizes
will finally recognise its impact on the “greatest benefits of mankind”.

Best regards,

A Mathematician
