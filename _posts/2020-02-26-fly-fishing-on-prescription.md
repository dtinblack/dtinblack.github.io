A TV fishing series has opened up a conversation about men's health. But is it all talk?

The TV series [Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_%26_Whitehouse:_Gone_Fishing) shows the comedians [Bob Mortimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Mortimer) and [Paul Whitehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Whitehouse) try, with mixed success, to catch a particular species of fish for example the beautiful coloured brown trout or the mighty carp. Each episode takes them to a scenic river or lake in the UK where they spend most of the day fishing. During the long periods of sitting waiting for a fish to bite they crack jokes, mess about and discuss life's great problems. The TV series has had an impact on men. I have lost count of the times when I mention that I am an angler there is a reply: "have you seen Gone Fishing?" which is an opener for a discussion about fishing and men's health. But is there any science to back up the claim that fishing can improve men's health?

The [statistics for men's health](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2019) in the UK makes grim reading: 68% of men are overweight and 14% of men have untreated high blood pressure. The statistics for men's [mental health](https://www.mind.org.uk/media/6771/get-it-off-your-chest_a4_final.pdf) has worsened with 37% admitting to regularly feeling worried or low in 2009 to 43% today.

Although on the surface, fishing doesn't seem to be as active as cycling, swimming or football, there is more going on than meets the eye. Studies have shown that there are many [benefits](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/tk-ways-fresh-air-impacts_0_n_5648164) from standing in the fresh air: boosting the immune system and increasing levels of energy.  Fishing also includes the challenges of how to reach the river bank with rods, nets, bait etc. and trying not to fall in! [Carrying equipment](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/health-benefits-walking/) strengthens muscles and improves heart health. Walking over the rough surfaces of a river bank or around a lake has been shown to [improve balance and coordination](https://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/wellbeing/fly-fishing-health-benefits).

Apart from the physical benefits there are mental health benefits to be gained from fishing. [Scientific reports](https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/publications-archive/brain/fly-fishing-brain) have shown that fishing provides a perfect stopgap measure for dealing with short-term stress. Also, in a recent [study](https://www.battlecreek.va.gov/features/Project_Healing_Water.asp),  a team of researchers found that combat veterans had significant reductions in stress and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms along with improvements in sleep quality after participating in fly fishing. Also, studies have shown that connecting with fellow fishers and belonging to a club, and [learning new skills]((https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/learn-for-mental-wellbeing/) can boost self confidence and improve [mental health](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/five-steps-to-mental-wellbeing/).

In summary there are lots of scientific support for the physical and mental health benefits from fishing for men. Therefore my call to the medical professionals dealing with men's health is that instead of reaching for a programme of drugs, or activities with strange sounding names, why not prescribe some fishing?

Bob and Paul may not catch many fish during their TV series but they have caught the attention of the wider public and men in particular. Let's hope that the discussion continues and develops into concrete action to improve men's health.
