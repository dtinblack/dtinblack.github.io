I"Ø<p>There is always a point during the discussion of an idea for a new product, or service, when the killer question comes up: ‚ÄúBut will it make any money ?‚Äù Stumble at this point and an onslaught of questions will follow: ‚ÄúWho is gong to buy it ?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy will they buy it ?‚Äù, and so on until the idea is riddled and gasping. So what can be done ? - Preparation !</p>

<p>Over years of facing a barrage of questions about ideas for new products I have gathered the following series of questions that have helped me to prepare for those tricky moments:</p>

<p><b>What pain are you solving for the customer ?</b> ‚Äì Ideas about solving a customer‚Äôs
pain are often more robust than those that address less pressing desires, therefore clearly identify how your idea is going to help.</p>

<p><b>What is the phrase that pays ?</b> ‚Äì The discipline of describing an idea and its business potential in a short phrase strips away the peripheral aspects and
distills it to its essence. Your idea could be sumarised into an
<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2007-06-18/the-perfect-elevator-pitchbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice">The Elevator Pitch</a> for when you need to sell your idea in less than a minute!</p>

<p><b>Does the idea already exist ?</b> - Enter Google search ( or other search engines of your choice ) - check that the idea is not already a product. My experience is that for every 100 ideas that I have had then 99 are already either under development or are products being sold. If the product already exists don‚Äôt give up ! Can your idea be adapted to be better than what is currently out there ?</p>

<p><b>What has changed to give rise to the opportunity ?</b> ‚Äì You need to point to
specific changes in the competitive, technical or regulatory environment to explain the
origin of your idea for a product. You need to be driven more than a simple desire to be
an entrepreneur !</p>

<p><b>What do others think of your idea ?</b> - It is important to get feedback from as many people as possible. But be careful. The feedback needs to be honest and constructive. One approach is
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/xamde/summary-of-the-mom-test">The Mom Test</a> which is a good way to ask potential customers about an idea in a way that gets constructive feedback. Similarly when you are asked for feedback think carefully what is being asked and how you will reply. When I give feedback on an idea I use the
<a href="http://www.rightattitudes.com/2008/02/20/sandwich-feedback-technique/">The Sandwich Feedback Technique</a>: what is good about the idea, what isn‚Äôt so good, and what can be done to make the it better.</p>

<p><b>How big is the market ?</b> ‚Äì It is difficult to forecast the market for a new
product with any real precision. However back-of-the-envelope calculations can provide
a rudimentary estimate of market size and provide a check on overblown ambitions. Also, check out the size of the market that you are trying to enter and look at other products that are already there - why is your idea going to gain market share ?</p>

<p><b>If the idea involves new technology can it be developed in a ‚Äògarage‚Äô ?</b> ‚Äì How much of the new technology comes under your control e.g. software development, packaging,
hardware, processes etc. How are the development costs going to be kept down ? A useful approach to minimising startup costs is the<br />
<a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">Lean Startup</a>approach, an in particular the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum Viable Product</a>
where key aspects of the idea are demonstrated and learnings are gathered for further development.</p>

<p>There are many more questions that will help develop your idea into a new product but the ones above should help you prepare for a heavy storm of killer questions, and if it survives, then it will be strengthen for the next step in its journey to a successful product.</p>
