I"<p>As part of the UK Government‚Äôs <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54981425">green revolution</a> there will be a ban on the sale of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54981425">petrol and deisel cars from 2030</a>.  The only cars for sale will be Electric Vehicles ( EV ) but given the Government‚Äôs track record in combating <a href="https://www.un.org/en/un75/climate-crisis-race-we-can-win">climate crisis</a> how effective will it be?</p>

<p>There are many instances of governement policy not delivering its aims. Gordon Brown introduced tax breaks for diesel cars as the UK chancellor in 2001 because they emit less CO2 than petrol-powered cars, but it is now known that they emit other <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/01/uk-government-wrong-to-subsidise-diesel-says-former-minister">harmful pollutants</a>. This government policy resulted in 40% of the cars on the road being diesel and an on-going investigation on their <a href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/17/4/733.full.pdf">impact on health</a>.</p>

<p>Electric Vehicles have no exhaust pipe therefore it has zero emissions when on the road. But that is only looking at one part of the problem of a complex problem. A much better approach would be to consider the whole life cycle of the car. There are three elements in life cycle analysis: the amount of  <a href="https://climatechangeconnection.org/emissions/co2-equivalents/">CO2 Equivelant</a>( CO<sub>2</sub>e ) that is produced in making the EV, the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>e produced during the operation of the EV and finally the amount of  CO<sub>2</sub>e produced during its disposla. Searching on the web to find out the data to compare the life cycle of an EV with petrol and diesel is very difficult because of the many <a href="https://innovationorigins.com/en/producing-gasoline-and-diesel-emits-more-co2-than-we-thought/">assumptions</a> that are used to develop an point of view. A study by <a href="https://ricardo.com/news-and-media/news-and-press/ricardo-study-demonstrates-importance-of-whole-lif">Ricardo demonstrates CO2 emissions from a life cycle analysis</a> shows how a lifecycle analysis produces a different picture. For a standard gasoline car the estimated lifecycle emissions if 24 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>e , with 5.6 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>e  estimated in its production. For a EV it is 19 Tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>e  with 8.8 Tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>e  estimated in its production. Therefore based on these estimates the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub>e over the life of an EV is around 20% which is good but maybe not what the banner headline of ‚Äúzero emmisions‚Äù is suggesting.</p>

<p>The government‚Äôs plan for a green revolution is based on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution">ten key points plan for a green revolution</a> which covers, power generation, housing and transportation but doesn‚Äôt take into account any life cycle analysis for any of its elements. Therefore its effectiveness must be called into question.</p>

<p>Moving to zero emissions vehicles is a great step forward for managing the climate crisis and improving health, particularly in urban areas.
But rigorous analysis should be carried out to make sure that government policies will be as effective as they claim. Life cycle analysis gives a better picture of the overall impact a car, food production, housing etc. will have on the climate. Lets hope that we don‚Äôt end up with the similar situation that we had with diesel vehicles!</p>
