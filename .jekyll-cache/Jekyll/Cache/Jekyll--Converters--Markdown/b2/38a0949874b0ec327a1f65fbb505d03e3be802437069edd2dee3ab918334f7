I"<p>An incident happened over forty years ago that is still fresh in my mind and is a reminder of the impact that we have on our environment.</p>

<p>At the time I was renting a room in a friends home until I could find a permanent place to stay. After work we usually ended up at one of the many fine pubs that are in the Kent town of Faversham. After closing time we were on our way back along the main road to his to his house. It was a quiet summer evening and the only sound that could be heard was the rattling sound of an articulated lorry in the distance. Suddenly, my friend, who had never shown any athletic prowess other than lifting heavy pints of beer, shot off into the middle of the road and scooped up something in his hands. He quickly jumped back onto the pavement just as the lorry thundered past. He opened his hands to show a small hedgehog. After catching our breath we found a hedge where  carefully placed the hedgehog with its nose pointing towards the fields.</p>

<p>Over they years the number of hedgehogs that I have seen can be counted on one hand and I have not seen any in the last ten to fifteen years. Statistics confirm my impressions by showing that there has been an <a href="https://www.countryliving.com/uk/wildlife/countryside/a23022368/no-rural-hedgehogs-south-west-england-new-national-study/">80% decline in hedgehogs since the 1950s</a>.  The decline is due to the intensification of agriculture through the loss of hedgerows and permanent grasslands, increased field sizes, and the use of pesticides which reduce the amount of prey available.</p>

<p>The decline of the hedgehog is one amongst many species that are under threat of extinction from the way that we live. <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2019/october/the-state-of-nature-41-percent-of-the-uks-species-have-declined.html">Forty one percent of UK species have declined since 1970s</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/28/fish-stocks-continuing-to-fall-as-oceans-warm-study-finds">fish stocks continuing to fall as oceans warm</a>. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough">Sir David Attenborough</a> tirelessly points out we are only one of a multitude of species from an ecosystem that is the totality that contributes to the life on this planet. If one species, in this case us, dominates others then our future will eventually be threatened. A clear example of the threat to our own existence is the decline of bee which is due to <a href="https://friendsoftheearth.uk/nature/what-are-causes-bee-decline">intensive farming, climate change and pesticides</a>. It decline is best summarised in the quote loosly attributed to <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/08/27/einstein-bees/">Einstein</a> “If the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe then man would only have four years of life left.”</p>

<p>Governments around the world are scrambling to implement policies that will reduce <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases">Greenhouse Gases</a> in an attempt to reduce the impact of <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/">Climate Change</a>. Digging into some of the policies it is difficult to get a clear statements on how their policies will improve biodiversity.</p>

<p>In the USA the much lauded <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres109/BILLS-116hres109ih.pdf">Green New Deal</a> mentions “nature” but the policy’s emphasis is on how changes in economic activity will have to change to reduce green house gases. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Green_Deal">European Green Deal</a> where biodiversity gets a stronger mention its main emphasis is still on the changes in economic activity. In the UK there is a biodiversity strategy <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69446/pb13583-biodiversity-strategy-2020-111111.pdf">Biodiversity 2020: A strategy for England’s wildlife
and ecosystem services</a>
whose ambition is to guide England’s conservation effort during the next ten years. But it is a strategy rather than a legal requirement.  In general most governments have species protection policies in place but this is a rear guard action rather than being proactive in restoring biodiversity.  In the case of the hedgehog the UK government rejected a recent petition to make them a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300100">protected species</a> and in amongst the many pages of different governments policies I couldn’t translate their aims into clear actions that would improve their outlook.</p>

<p>In Sir David Attenborough’s opening essay of the <a href="https://www.zsl.org/sites/default/files/LPR20%20Part%20B_Voices%20for%20a%20living%20planet.pdf">Living Planet Report 2020</a> he argues that we are entering the “The Anthropocene -the Age when
humans dominated the earth. The age when innumerable natural
connections were broken”. If this is the case then government at all levels: international, national and local levels need to give more emphasis to biodiversity in all of their policies to ensure that we full our obligations as stewards of the environment. We need policies to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Encourage and promote the enthusiasm of the different groups and organisations working to save different species to help save, re-introduce and coordinate various species. In the case of the hedgehog there are a number of groups such as the <a href="https://www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk/">British Hedgehog Preservation Society</a>, but they all face an uphill challenge. However, taping into their skills for measuring the number of species that they are fighting for so that clear targets can be set.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide incentives for any economic activity that improves biodiversity such as the UK’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-environmental-land-management-scheme-an-overview/the-environmental-land-management-scheme-public-money-for-public-goods">The Environmental Land Management scheme: public money for public goods</a> but with a stronger emphasis on biodiversity. In the UK there are encouraging signs with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-bill-2020">2020 Environment Bill</a> which will into law environmental protections and recovery. But the <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0220/amend/environment_rm_rep_1203.pdf">hedgehog was added at a late stage</a> in its development whereas it should have been, along with other threatened species, at the top of its agenda.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increase the research into how biodiversity can help with Climate Change. Recent work with reestablishing Beavers has shown how that they <a href="https://www.fwi.co.uk/news/environment/environmental-issues-wildlife/can-beavers-and-farms-work-together-on-flood-control">can improve flood control</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Like Sir David Attenbourough I will not see the Anthropocence phase on the planet but I hope that we scoop up the rest of species, including hedgehogs, ahead of the Climate Emergency and return it to its rightful place before it is to late.</p>

I’m truly sorry Man’s dominion<br />
Has broken Nature’s social union,<br />
An’ justifies that ill opinion<br />
Which makes thee startle<br />
At me, thy poor, earth-born companion<br />
An’ fellow-mortal!<br />
