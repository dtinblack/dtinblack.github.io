I"@<p>As part of the UK Government’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54981425">green revolution</a> there will be a ban on the sale of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54981425">petrol and deisel cars from 2030</a>.  The only cars for sale will be Electric Vehicles ( EV ) but given the Government’s track record in combating <a href="https://www.un.org/en/un75/climate-crisis-race-we-can-win">climate crisis</a> how effective will it be?</p>

<p>There are many instances of governement policy not delivering its aims. Gordon Brown introduced tax breaks for diesel cars as the UK chancellor in 2001 because they emit less CO2 than petrol-powered cars, but it is now known that they emit other <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/01/uk-government-wrong-to-subsidise-diesel-says-former-minister">harmful pollutants</a>. This government policy resulted in 40% of the cars on the road being diesel and an on-going investigation on their <a href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/17/4/733.full.pdf">impact on health</a>.</p>

<p>Electric Vehicles have no exhaust pipe therefore it has zero emissions when on the road. But that is only looking at one part of the problem of a complex problem. A much better approach would be to consider the whole life cycle of the car. There are three elements in life cycle analysis: the amount of  <a href="https://climatechangeconnection.org/emissions/co2-equivalents/">CO2 Equivelant</a>( CO<sub>2</sub>e ) that is produced in making the EV, the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>e produced during the operation of the EV and finally its end-of-life, in otherwords its disposal. Searching on the web to find out the data to compare th elife cycle of an EV with petrol and diesel is very difficult because of the many <a href="https://innovationorigins.com/en/producing-gasoline-and-diesel-emits-more-co2-than-we-thought/">assumptions</a> that are used to develop an opinion. However, a study by <a href="https://ricardo.com/news-and-media/news-and-press/ricardo-study-demonstrates-importance-of-whole-lif">Ricardo demonstrates CO2 emissions from a life cycle analysis</a> which shows a different picture that it can give. For a standard gasoline vehicle the estimated lifecycle emissions if 24 tonees CO<sub>2</sub>e , with 5.6 tonnes CO2e estimated in its production. For a EV it is 19 Tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>e  with 8.8 Tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>e  estimated in its production. Therefore based on these estimaes the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub>e over the life of an EV is around 20% which is good but maybe not what the banner headline of “zero emmisions” is potraying.</p>

<p>The government’s plan for a green revolution is based on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution">ten key points plan for a green revolution</a> which includes the decarbonisation of the running of the economy but doesn’t take into account any life cycle analysis. Another aspect is that it doesn’t take into account the overall transport system. For example carrying out a life cycle analysis impact of HS2 <a href="https://usefulprojects.co.uk/project/high-speed-two/">High Speed Two (HS2)</a> aims to create a world class high speed rail network to support economic growth, both in cities it connects, and for the UK.</p>

<ul>
  <li>need to do a life cycle analysis:</li>
</ul>

<p>Althought there are <a href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/why/carbon/">plans to reduce</a> the amount of CO2 during its construction estimates   for constructing HS2 is between 8 - 14 million Tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>e.</p>

<ul>
  <li>how much CO2e to build a train? - everything found on the web misses out on how much CO2 is produced in making an electric train and carriages - take best guess using the car equivelent i.e.</li>
</ul>

<p>https://aetransport.org/public/downloads/hhowj/5342-5218a24ae8a89.pdf - see table for rolling stock - 19.2 thousand Co2 over a 50 year period.</p>

<p>Doesn’t include freight -</p>

<p>Assuming the same levels of train loading as for diesel-hauled services, it was estimated that electrified freight services emitted a similar amount of CO2 per tonne-km (13.9 gms)3. This suggests that the weighted average CO2-intensity for railfreight operations in the UK is 14.5 gms per tonne-km4. https://www.abtslogistics.co.uk/green-logistics-resources/d82cc048-4b92-4c2a-a014-af1eea7d76d0_CO2%20Emissions%20from%20Freight%20Transport%20-%20An%20Analysis%20of%20UK%20Data.pdf</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rail transported 17.8 billion tonne kilometres [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/552492/rail-freight-strategy.pdf]</li>
</ul>

<p>It is estimated that an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/jul/16/electric-trains-diesel-green-carbon">electric train uses</a> less “Typically an electric train emits 20–35% less carbon per passenger mile than a diesel train.” and each passenger journey is typically <a href="https://www.seat61.com/CO2flights.htm">around 24 Kg CO<sub>2</sub>e </a> HS2 claim that it will caryy <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/hs2_claim_it_will_carry_over_300">300,000 passnegers per day</a>  <a href="https://iea.org.uk/hs2-wont-help-the-government-meet-its-climate-change-goals/">HS2 life-span of 120 years</a> ( it is interesting that the success of HS2 is based on an assumption of 120 years - look what has happened in the last year from a pandemic! )</p>

<p>There is no information about decomssion a railway line but lets assume that it is left to rot.  Total 315360 Tonnes ( need to check ) - may need to calculate per year .</p>

<p>In 2019, net territorial emissions in the UK of the basket of seven greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol were estimated to be 454.8 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), a decrease of 2.8% compared to the 2018 figure of 468.1 million tonnes and 43.8% lower than they were in 1990 <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957887/2019_Final_greenhouse_gas_emissions_statistical_release.pdf">report</a> - MtCO2e refers to million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This is a consistent measure of assessing the contribution of greenhouse gases to global warming.</p>

<p>Not taking ito account he full life cycle of anything that is produced whether it is vehicles, food or anything els that we consume doesn’t take into account th efull picture and therefore the progress that we hope to make against Climate Crisis may not be as effective as we hoped. By not taking into account a wider picture usually results in a failure of the original aims.</p>

<p>Moving to zero emmisions vehicles is a great step forward for not onluy the fight against the climate crisis but also improving health in urban areas with improved air quality. But a clearer analysis needs to be carried out to make sure that governement policies will be as effetive overall as they claim - th edevil is in the detail. One approach is using a life cycle analysis. Lets hope that we don’t end up with the similar situation that we had with diesel vehicles!</p>
