I have found the following information useful in improving the readability of my posts:

### Persuasive Writing Techniques

The post should use techniques to persuaded the reader about the point that you are trying to make. Examples can be found in [10 Timeless Persuasive Writing Techniques](https://copyblogger.com/persuasive-writing/). Another aspect is to make the reader curious, examples can be found in [Antidote for partisanship? In science, curiosity seems to work](https://news.yale.edu/2017/01/26/antidote-partisanship-science-curiosity-seems-work).

Advice from famous writers can help improve a post, for example Kurt Vonnegut has given us some of the most advice on the art and craft of writing see: [How to Write with Style: Kurt Vonnegut’s 8 Keys to the Power of the Written Word](https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/01/14/how-to-write-with-style-kurt-vonnegut/), or George Orwell's [Six Rules of Writing](https://infusion.media/blog/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing/):

(i) Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print. <br>

(ii) Never use a long word where a short one will do. <br>

(iii) If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out. <br>

(iv) Never use the passive where you can use the active. <br>

(v) Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent. <br>

(vi) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

Although not advice from a blog about making writing persuasive the following video describes the [Feynman Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-16DPh_VWw) for taking complex subject and translating it into everyday language.

### Point of View

[Point of view](https://grammar.collinsdictionary.com/easy-learning/what-is-the-first-person-the-second-person-and-the-third-person-in-english) is the writer’s way of deciding who is telling the story to whom. Establishing a clear point of view is important because it dictates how your reader interprets characters, events, and other important details. There are three kinds of point of view: first person, second person, and third person. The following video gives a clear description: <br>

### Word Count

Word limit is important for two reasons: the length of the article should fit into the time that the target reader has to read the post e.g. a couple of minutes over a coffee, and an editing discipline - keeping the post to a target word length helps to sharpen up the thought(s) that are being communicated. The average [reading speed](https://wordsrated.com/reading-speed-statistics/) is about 183 words per minute.   

Using website such as [Count Wordsmith](https://countwordsworth.com/) will analyse the post's text, including the number of metaphors and similes, so that it can be improved.

### Readability Tests

The following tests can be used to improve the [readability](https://readable.com/readability/new-dale-chall-readability-formula/) of the text in a post:

#### [Fog Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index)

| <b>Fog Index</b> | <b>Reading level by grade</b> |

See the following website [Gunning Fog Index](http://gunning-fog-index.com/) where text can be cut & paste to calculate the index.


#### [Dale-Chall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale%E2%80%93Chall_readability_formula)

### Grammar

To keep a post's text lean make sure that [adverbs](https://www.yourdictionary.com/articles/adverbs-list-printable) are kept to a [minimum](https://writetodone.com/shoot-adverbs/). Another aspect is when to use [capital letters](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/write/capital-letters.html), apart from at the beginning of a sentence.

Ensure that most of the sentences [active](https://www.theschoolrun.com/what-are-active-and-passive-sentences) i.e. the subject of the sentence is performing the action. For example, Dickens’ use of passive sentences ( mainly dialogue and formal statements ) is less than 10%. Websites such as Grammarly have a [passive voice checker](https://www.grammarly.com/passive-voice-checker) but is not free. However, the [Hemmingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/) is free.

[A cat, a hat and a simple measure of gobbledygook: How readable is your writing?](https://bankunderground.co.uk/2016/10/04/a-cat-a-hat-and-a-simple-measure-of-gobbledygook-how-readable-is-your-writing/#more-2108) is a general article that uses some of the reading tests described above and applied to financial industry.

### Punctuation

[Punctuation](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/write/punctuation1.html) is important when clarifying the thought(s) being expressed in the post.

### Titles

A series of blogs that discuss titles and their impact on the readers that I have found useful are:

[How to Write Headlines That Work](https://copyblogger.com/how-to-write-headlines-that-work/) - making the title ( or headline ) so that a browser turns into a reader.

[5 Easy Tricks to Help You Write Catchy Headlines](https://goinswriter.com/catchy-headlines/)

The following generates some interesting headlines: [headline title maker](https://www.portent.com/tools/title-maker/)

### Endings

It is important to close the post in a way that the reader remembers what you have written about. Some ideas can be found in [9 Ways to Crush the End of a Blog Post](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-end-blog-post).

Some ideas on endings for endings can be found in books, see [The 10 Best Book Endings](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/tip-sheet/article/56760-the-10-best-book-endings.html)

### Inspiring Quotes

An old trawler man's saying “Fail we may, sail we must” - in other words it is better to write something and fail than never to have written anything.

“Writing a book is not unlike building a house or planning a battle or painting a picture. The technique is different, the materials are different, but the principle is the same. The foundations have to be laid, the data assembled, and the premises must bear the weight of their conclusions.""

“The whole when finished is only the successful presentation of a theme” - Winston Churchill


"The heat of the sun on your face and the calculations performed to predict its path are like ‘ a cross bearing’." - Winston Churchill


"It is not the state of the letter that delivers the message - it is the benefit of the message that is important" - Winston Churchill
