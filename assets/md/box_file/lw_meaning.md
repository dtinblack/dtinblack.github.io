<b>Notes</b>

"“My father was a businessman and I am a businessman too; I want my philosophy to be businesslike, to get something done, to get something settled.” - “Conversations with Wittgenstein” (in K. T. Fann (ed.), Wittgenstein: The Man and his Philosophy, Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978).
It appears on p. 69 of Drury’s contribution and attributes the quote to a conversation Wittgenstein had with Drury.
