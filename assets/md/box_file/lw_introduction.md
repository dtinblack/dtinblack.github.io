<b>Opening Sentences - how I came across Wittgenstein - book shop at Cranfield</b>

About fifty years ago I came across a copy of Wittgenstein's Logico Tractatus ( know as the Tractatus ) in the university bookshop. Little did I know then that not only is that book still on my bookshelf but it has been joined by well over a hundred more!

<b>Background</b>

When I picked up the copy of the Tractatus I was about half way through an Msc in Applied Mathematics. the course. The course was a conversion form engineering to mathematics. It was during { need to describe how I first came across Wittgenstein }

Engineering and Mathematics
Over 50 years of reading and studying Wittgenstein, against a background of a normal life. Why? - puzzled - feel that he is saying something important but I failed to understand.

<b>Challenges of reading Wittgenstein</b>

- lots of books - mainly academics arguing over interpretation - books to learn from - see my book list.
- Wittgenstein deals with something that we take for granted - language - therefore when reading his works you have to ask lots of questions.
- Wittgenstein's early and later philosophy requires a lot of context therefore reading around the topics that he was investigating. Also, in his early work - the Tractatus - requires understanding logi which although not difficult still takes time.
- need to say something about being an amateur compared to to professional ( something that needs to  overcome if you are a self-learner )


<b>Series of notes</b>

- mainly about his later work but will use the tractatus as a comparison
- examples will be kept straight forwaerd. For example, any maths that will be used will be artithemetc i.e. everday counting and measruing.
- Overal the notes are aimed at what I call 'self-learners', like myself, so that armed with a cup of coffee, or any other suitable drink, you can work through his approach.  


<b>Start of the notes</b>

Notes will provide an outline of Wittgnstein's approach to philosophical problems.  

1. "Finding my way about"


<b>Notes</b>

- Why - Aristotle - Knowing yourself is the begining of all knowledge", and the "purpose of knowldege is action, not knowledge"
