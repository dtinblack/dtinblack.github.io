<b>Opening Sentences - how I came across Wittgenstein - book shop at Cranfield</b>

The following notes are for those who have similar thoughts about Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics. Following Wittgenstein, the level of mathematics used in the notes is at an elementary level.

<b>Background</b>

After I completed my degree agricultural engineering, in the early 70s, employment was not looking great. I had always been good at mathes so a lecturer suggested that I should apply for a conversion course ate Cranfield Institute of Technology ( now Cranfield University ) that took engineers and turned them into mathematians at MSc level. My application was successfull and I my career sprospects opened up aided by the emerge of a new technology called computers!

One afternoon I came across Russell and Whitheads three volume Pricipia Mathematica. The work reduceed arithmatic, the back bone of mathematics, to logic {     }. I couldn't get past the first few pages. When I returned to the study area I asked a colleuque if he know of anyone that understood the Principia. He quickly replied that he knew of at least four people: the authors themselves, Kurt Goedel and Wittgnestein. I had heard of Goedel because I few weeks earlier I had attended a Phd student's presentation about his work. But I had never heard about Wittgenstein. My colleague went on to give an outline of his life, how he started as an engineer, then developedn ainterest in the philsophical analysis which lead him to Bertrand Russell an Frege. Whith a few weeks I stumbled across the Tractatus.
About fifty years ago I came across a copy of Wittgenstein's Logico Tractatus ( known as the Tractatus ) in my university bookshop. Little did I know then that not only is that book still on my bookshelf but it has been joined by well over a hundred more!

When I picked up the copy of the Tractatus I was half way through an MSc in Applied Mathematics. The course took engineers and turned them into mathematicians.


<b>Challenges of reading Wittgenstein</b>

- lots of books - mainly academics arguing over interpretation - books to learn from - see my book list.
- Wittgenstein deals with something that we take for granted - language - therefore when reading his works you have to ask lots of questions.
- Wittgenstein's early and later philosophy requires a lot of context therefore reading around the topics that he was investigating. Also, in his early work - the Tractatus - requires understanding logi which although not difficult still takes time.
- need to say something about being an amateur compared to to professional ( something that needs to  overcome if you are a self-learner )


<b>Series of notes</b>

- mainly about his later work but will use the tractatus as a comparison
- examples will be kept straight forwaerd. For example, any maths that will be used will be artithemetc i.e. everday counting and measruing.
- Overal the notes are aimed at what I call 'self-learners', like myself, so that armed with a cup of coffee, or any other suitable drink, you can work through his approach.  


<b>Start of the notes</b>

Notes will provide an outline of Wittgnstein's approach to philosophical problems.  

1. "Finding my way about"


<b>Notes</b>

- Why - Aristotle - Knowing yourself is the begining of all knowledge", and the "purpose of knowldege is action, not knowledge"
