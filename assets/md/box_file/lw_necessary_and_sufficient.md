<b>Introduction - struggle with the ideas for many years - logic and mathematics</b>

I have lost count of the number of years that I have struggled with the meaning of the words <i>necessary</i> and <i>sufficient</i> in logic and mathematics. But what follows is a Wittgensteinina approach to clarifiying how the words are being used.

<b>Taking a Wittgenstein approach - language-games to untangle the problem - "a perspicuous view"</b>



<b>Everyday use of the words and how they are used i.e. use the signalling idea</b>

- examples of Necessary

- examples of Sufficient

- examples of Necessary and Sufficient


<b>Language-game of propositional calculus</b>

- describe conditional statements ( see Lemmon ) - propositional variables.


<b>Conditional statements - explain the difference between maths/logic and everday use</b>

- difference is that every proposition must be either true or false, compare with the everday.


<b>Necessary and Sufficient in the language-game of propositional logic</b>


<b>Summary & Conclusion</b>
