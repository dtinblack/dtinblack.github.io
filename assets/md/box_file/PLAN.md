# box files: Outline plan of the notes

A. My introduction and subsequent study of Wittgenstein's philosophy.

B. When do we have a problem where Wittgenstein's approach would be suitable - "I Don't Know My Way About"

C. Using Wittgenstein's later philosophy e.g. forms of life, language-games etc. try and pull together a process for resolving the problems identified in section B.

D. Examples:

- Applied to the Tractatus - where Wittgenstein started.
- Sufficient and Necessary ( already started - drafting )
- The infinite in maths and other areas ( foundations etc. )
- Computers and consciousness ( ? )
