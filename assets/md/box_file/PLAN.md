# box files: Outline plan of the notes about Wittgenstein's philosophy

A. Paraphrase Wittgenstein's introduction to the Tractatus - "This book will perhaps only be understood by those who have themselves already thought the thoughts which are expressed in itor similar
thoughts. It is therefore not a text-book. Its object would be attained if there were one person who read it with understanding and to whom it afforded pleasure"

- These notes will be understood by anyone who has thought about the application of mathematics, and more importantly its limits.


Why you need to be interested in Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics - the case for reading these notes.

B. How I came across Wittgenstein, and subsequent study of Wittgenstein's philosophy.

C. When do we have a problem where Wittgenstein's approach would be suitable - "I Don't Know My Way About"

D. Using Wittgenstein's later philosophy e.g. forms of life, language-games etc. try and pull together a process for resolving the problems identified in section B.


E. Examples:

- Applied to the Tractatus - where Wittgenstein started with his later philosophy.
- Sufficient and Necessary ( already started - drafting )
- The infinite in maths and other areas ( foundations etc. )
- Computers and consciousness ( ? )
- Proof ( Euclid's interpreted by Wittgenstein )
